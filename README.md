# Discover-React
{EPITECH} - EIP : ChromaCase repo to discover react and react native

## React

### Notes

#### History
React (or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library developped by Facebook since 2013.

#### Description
It only handles the interface of the application (front-end) and can be used with another lib to handle the back.
One of its biggest assets is its flexibility and performance (it works with a virtual DOM that only updates the UI when needed)

#### Functionalities
It was conceived as a library and not a framework which encourages the creation of reusable components taking data as an entry and this data can change.
There are no template system and only works with JavaScript.
To ease the writing Facebook designed a language JSX allowig to generate JavaScript objects with a notation close to HTML.

## React native

### Notes

#### History

React Native is a framework developped by Facebook to make iOS and Android applications using React

Developped in 2015

#### Differences with React JS

React Native does not use HTML nor CSS, it uses JavaScript's thread messages to manipulate the views

React native does not manipulate the DOM, the DOM is running in the background on the terminal and communicates with the platform via serialized data over an asynchronous and batched bridge
